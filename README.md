Software for a quadruped robot inspired by the [Stanford Pupper](https://stanfordstudentrobotics.org/pupper),
but built using small, inexpensive servos (that unfortunately do not have nearly enough torque to be even remotely useful).

CAD for 3D printed parts and lasercut base [here](https://a360.co/2TiKAct), legs use same principle as Stanford Pupper.
